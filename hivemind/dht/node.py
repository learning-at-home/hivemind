class DHTNode:
    """
    A low-level class that represents DHT participant.
    Each DHTNode has an identifier, a local storage and access too other nodes via KademliaProtocol.
    Note: unlike Kademlia, nodes in a Hivemind DHT is optimized to store temporary metadata that is regularly updated
     For example, an expert alive timestamp that emitted by the Server responsible for that expert.
     Such metadata does not require maintenance such as ensuring at least k hosts have it or (de)serialization in case
     of node shutdown. Instead, DHTNode is designed to reduce the latency of looking up such data.
