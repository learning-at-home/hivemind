class DHTNode:
    """
    A low-level class that represents a DHT participant.
    Each DHTNode has an identifier, a local storage and access too other nodes via KademliaProtocol.

    :param node_id: current node's identifier, determines which keys it will store locally, defaults to random id
    :param port: port to which this DHTNode will listen, by default find some open port
    :param initial_peers: connects to these peers to populate routing table, defaults to no peers
    :param bucket_size: (k) - max number of nodes in one k-bucket. Trying to add {k+1}st node will cause a bucket to
      either split in two buckets along the midpoint or reject the new node (but still save it as a replacement)
      Recommended value: $k$ is chosen s.t. any given k nodes are very unlikely to all fail after staleness_timeout
    :param beam_size: (alpha) - the number of concurrent requests when performing beam search (find node/value)
    :param modulo: (b) - kademlia can split bucket if it contains root OR up to the nearest multiple of :depth_modulo:
    :param staleness_timeout: a bucket is considered stale if no node from that bucket was updated for this many seconds
    :param wait_timeout: a kademlia rpc request is deemed lost if we did not recieve a reply in this many seconds
    :param bootstrap_timeout: after one of peers responds, await other peers for at most this many seconds

    Note: Hivemind DHT is optimized to store temporary metadata that is regularly updated.
     For example, an expert alive timestamp that emitted by the Server responsible for that expert.
     Such metadata does not require maintenance such as ensuring at least k hosts have it or (de)serialization in case
     of node shutdown. Instead, DHTNode is designed to reduce the latency of looking up such data.

    Every (key, value) pair in this DHT has expiration_time - float number computed wth time.monotonic().
    Informally, dht nodes always prefer values with higher expiration_time and may delete any value past its expiration.

    Formally, DHTNode follows this contract:
      - when asked to store(key, value, expiration_time), a node must store (key, value) at least until expiration_time
       unless it already stores that key with greater or equal expiration_time - if so, node must keep the previous key
      - when asked to get(key), a node must return the value with highest expiration time IF that time has not come yet
       if expiration time is greater than current time.monotonic(), DHTNode *may* return None
