        By default, all validators are applied sequentially (i.e. we require all validate() calls

        However, you may want to define another policy for combining your validator classes
        (e.g. for schema validators, we want to require only one validate() call to return True
        because each validator bears a part of the schema).

        This can be achieved with overriding merge_with(). It should:

          - Return True if it has successfully merged the `other` validator to `self`,
            so that `self` became a validator that combines the old `self` and `other` using
            the necessary policy. In this case, `other` should remain unchanged.

          - Return False if the merging has not happened. In this case, both `self` and `other`
            should remain unchanged. The DHT will try merging `other` to another validator or
            add it as a separate validator (to be applied sequentially).
