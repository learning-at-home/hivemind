"""
This is a Distributed Hash Table optimized for rapidly accessing a lot of lightweight metadata.
Hivemind DHT is based on Kademlia [1] with added support for improved bulk store/get operations and caching.

The code is organized as follows:

 * **class DHT (__init__.py)** - high-level class for model training. Runs DHTNode in a background process.
 * **class DHTNode (node.py)** - an asyncio implementation of dht server, stores AND gets keys.
 * **class DHTProtocol (protocol.py)** - an RPC protocol to request data from dht nodes.
 * **async def traverse_dht (traverse.py)** - a search algorithm that crawls DHT peers.

    """
    High-level interface to hivemind.dht that is designed to allow RemoteMixtureOfExperts to select best experts.

    :param initial_peers: one or multiple endpoints pointing to active DHT peers. Similar format to listen_on.
    :param listen_on: an interface for incoming connections, e.g. "127.0.0.1:*", "0.0.0.0:1234" or "ipv6:[::]:*"
    :param start: if True, automatically starts the background process on creation. Otherwise await manual start
    :param daemon: if True, the background process is marked as daemon and automatically terminated after main process
    :param max_workers: declare_experts and get_experts will use up to this many parallel workers
        (but no more than one per key)
    :param expiration: experts declared from this node expire after this many seconds (default = 5 minutes)
    :param receiver_threads: uses this many threads to await on input pipe. Default = 1 should be enough in most cases
    :param kwargs: any other params will be forwarded to DHTNode upon creation

    Each expert has an identifier in the form of {prefix}.{i}.{j}.{...}, e.g. "ffn_expert.98.76.54.32.10"
    An expert identifier consists of:

        * optional prefix that determines expert role, experiment name, etc.
        * one or more integers that determine that expert's position in an N-dimensional grid

    A hivemind.Server can ``DHT.declare_experts(expert_uids: List[str])`` to make its experts visible to everyone.
    When declaring experts, DHT will store each expert's uid and all its prefixes until :expiration: (specified at init)
    For instance, declaring "ffn_expert.98.76.54.32.10" will store the following keys in a DHT:
    ``"ffn_expert", "ffn_expert.98", "ffn_expert.98.76", ..., "ffn_expert.98.76.54.32.10"``

    RemoteMixtureOfExperts can use these prefixes to find top-k most suitable experts with a left-to-right beam search.
    For instance, consider RemoteMixtureOfExperts with prefix "ffn_expert" and grid size [100, 100, 100, 100, 100].
    This MoE can query all experts with that prefix and arbitrary indices in 0...99 along each dimension.
    However, not every expert in such 100^5 grid can be alive at a given moment of time (the grid size is redundant).
    In order to find k best "alive" experts, MoE first ranks indices along the first dimension with its gating function.
    It can then check which of those indices correspond to "alive" experts by querying keys such as "ffn_expert.98".
    This is done using DHT.first_k_active function. After selecting k best indices along first dimension, MoE moves
    to the second dimension. It can find top-k pairs of indices (e.g. "expert.98.76") that start with one of k first
    indices from the previous step. Finally, MoE will use DHT.get_experts(uids: List[str]) search for specific experts.
    This beam search explores one additional dimension per step and finds k best experts from across the DHT
    in O(k / s * log(N)) average time where s is grid sparsity rate and N is the total number of experts.
