# Related projects

In this section, we list several organizations and research projects that bring humanity closer to the dream of world-scale deep learning with volunteer computing.
* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) — an AI community with world-leading NLP research that builds collaborative hub training using hivemind. 
* [EYDLE](https://www.eydle.com) — a start-up that works towards distributed deep learning on volunteer hardware using centralized infrastructure.
* [BitTensor](https://github.com/opentensor/BitTensor) — a decentralized deep learning ecosystem with incentive
  mechanism. Each peer trains for its own objective and rewards others for useful features. 
* Also building collaborative deep learning? Let us know! [TODO EMAIL]
