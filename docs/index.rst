Hivemind is a library for decentralized deep learning computations. It allows you to train large neural networks using vast numbers
of computers, whether you're running a very capable computer or a less reliable one.
Learn how to create or join a Hivemind run in the `quickstart tutorial <./user/quickstart.html>`__ or browse the API
documentation below.

| Hivemind is currently in active development, so expect some adventures. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them
  in `our Discord chat <https://discord.com/invite/uGugx9zYvN>`_ or
  file an `issue <https://github.com/learning-at-home/hivemind/issues>`__.
